# evm-api

This project is a clone of eth-ruby-tools.

The objective is to allow using QuickNode to send trasnactions instead of having to rund full Geth nodes.

For Ethereum Blockchain (ETH, ERC20) Peatio uses these methods:
  * eth_blockNumber
  * eth_getBalance
  * eth_call
  * eth_getTransactionReceipt
  * eth_getBlockByNumber
  * personal_newAccount
  * personal_sendTransaction
